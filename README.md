chemistry-mole-conversion
=========================

User can enter the symbol for an element, and the number of moles needed. Hit submit to return the number of ounces and grams needed. 

This is a work in progress. Currently only one element symbol at a time is accepted. "Convert" returns the atomic mass, and also calculates ounces and grams needed based on number of moles entered in the moles field. 

Future iterations will include: 

1. Ability to enter entire chemical formulas, which will require a function that takes the numbers entered and multiplies by the atomic mass of the preceding element. It will need to loop through an entire formula and come up with a tally of the molar mass of the compound. 
2. Ability to convert from grams and ounces to moles. Currently user must enter number of moles needed in order to receive an answer. 
3. Eventually, the ability to accept a chemical formula and return the common name for that formula. For instance, the user would enter "Ag2SeO3" and the form would return "silver selenite". This may require a database. 

Feel free to fork or make suggestions.
